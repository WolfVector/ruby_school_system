# School System

A simplistic school system that I made when I was learning Ruby On Rails. It incorporates an <a href="https://github.com/WolfVector/ruby_auth" target="_blank">auth system</a> I also made.

The school system handles

- **Assignatures**: creation, update and elimination
- **Class**: creation, update and elimination
- **Professor**: creation, update and elimination
- **Student**: creation, update and elimination
- **Student Schedule**: creation, update and elimination
- Students can vizualise their grades
- Professor can upload the grades of their students
- Administrators are the ones who register the assignature for a given period, and their corresponding professors

The project is not intented for professional purporse, I made it to learn Ruby.
